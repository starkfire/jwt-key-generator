# Contributing to jwt-key-generator

First of all, thank you for your interest to contribute to this project. Contributions to this project are highly welcome, and feel free to submit pull requests and issues.

So far, the project is wrapped around Node's [Web Crypto API](https://nodejs.org/api/webcrypto.html). The current features of this project uses the API, especially in generating and exporting keys. However, interests to add features that are outside the scope of Web Crypto API are also highly welcome, just as long as it covers the JWT key generation aspect, the library's ease-of-use and compatibility with existing JWT libraries.
